The project idea was to train an agent in Unity to control an aircraft with physics properties close to real aircraft. After research about setting up an aircraft in Unity with aerodynamics, the aircraft's physics were meticulously configured to replicate real-world behavior as closely as possible.
Aerodynamics: The aircraft's aerodynamic properties, including lift, drag, and thrust, were accurately simulated based on real-world principles. This involved modeling airflow over the aircraft's surfaces, taking into account factors such as airfoil shapes, angle of attack, and airspeed.
Weight and Balance: The distribution of weight within the aircraft, including fuel, cargo, and passengers, was accurately modeled to affect its stability and maneuverability. Changes in weight distribution would impact the aircraft's center of gravity, requiring adjustments in control inputs.
